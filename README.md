# Shader Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal shader projects repository! Here, I showcase various shader experiments written in GLSL. Some of these projects are exercises from [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/), serving as training exercises and creative explorations.

## Running the Shaders

To view and interact with the shaders, visit [Editor - The Book of Shaders](http://editor.thebookofshaders.com/) website. Copy the shader code from the respective project file in this repository and paste it into the editor to see real-time rendering.

## Usage

Explore the shaders in this repository to see different visual effects. Browse through project files to view GLSL code or run shaders on The Book of Shaders website.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to The Book of Shaders for the platform and educational resources.
